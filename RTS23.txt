08.06.2016  1. watchdog reset io - PORTC7 - set to 0 0 (input tri state)
            2. direction of PORTB4 set to 0
            3. direction of PORTB2 set to 0
13/06/2016  1. check battery every minute. if its under 3400 disable wireless and do not connect. only when its more than 3600 -  redo everything.
            2. if CREG return 3 - denide - half or more times in a row - stop the registration of this operator
15/06/2016  treat battery as sensor 0.
19/06/2016  change IO's on PowerDownSleep to reuven's IO's, cos of high-flow intake during sleep.
28/03/2017  replace the var "heat_time" name to "nTimeCnt"
            insert check of GPS. file name is GPS_Manager.c
30/04/2017  1. if sim is JTC like movistar - look for list of operators.
            2. GPS_Manager - a. checl length of uartRxCnt before copy UAR1 buffer to local buffer
            b. set MINMEA_MAX_LENGTH to 200.
            c. put the while condition to index + 5
2017:
            Data manager:
            1.    lat & lon – order of sending
            2.    read of  sensor control parameters from eeprom
            3.    delete func InitSensorBlocks

            General:
            1.    delete tagSwitched
            2.    insert new func SetUART1BaudRate
            3.    baudrate of uart1
            4.    ADC initialization
            5.    change timer1 configuration
            6.    after InitRTC add SetRtc24Hour
            7.    check for battery status and act according to it
            8.    after reset starts with monitor (not masure)
            9.    IsLedWorking – checks if all 3 leds are working
            10.    turn off watchdog in the beginning of PowerDownSleep
            11.    wait 30 sec in case all 3 leds are working
            12.	PowerDownSleep – IO changes
            13.	TurnOnLed – only on external reset and no leds on failure
            14.	delete pin-change interrupt
            15.	InitProgram – add init for leds and for battery status
            16.	add function UART1Select
            17.	SendDebugMsg – working with wireless

            Gps Manager:
            1.	add module

            Interrupts:
            1.	putchar1 – select uart1 first
            2.	timer0_ovf_isr – when end of rx -print rx buffer of uart0
            3.	timer2_ovf_isr – enlarge the gap of waiting till end of input.
            4.	timer2_ovf_isr – end of GPS when reach to max buffer
            5.	flgUart1Error – add
            6.	delete pin change interrupt
            7.	TransmitBuf – remove "while (bWaitForMonitorCmd == TRUE);" //wait until rx1 end.

            RTC managet
            1.	SetRealTime – return success only after check if need SetRtc24Hour

            Modem Manager:
            1.	SendATCmd – if modem model is 4D – should change a digit in few AT commands
            2.	Is4dModem – check model of modem
            3.	Leds
            4.	config baudrate

            Wireless manager:
            1.	init "index" field of WLSenArr
            2.	fGotData – flag to sign some data arrived from receiver
            3.	nBadAnswer – flag to sign that got data but bad
            4.	 nDataok – flag to sign that got data and it ok
            5.	nCycles – flag to count number of times reading from receiver performed this time
            6.	clear RxUart1Buf and rx1_buff_len before every reading
            7.	check if no data msg arrived
            8.	look for header. Not assume that it first byte


VERSION: W.5.17.5
16/05/2017  1.set modemOnStartUp to FALSE when init
VERSION: W.5.17.6
21/05/2017  1. Led1 star blink while look 4 GPS. when finished - is on continuous.
            2. Add DeepSleep function and powerOnReset flag. if reset source is Power on - do not start normal run but go to deep sleep till
            reset button is pressed.
1-22/06/2017    1. batery limmit - if battery going down one of the limits (modem connecting or wireless) - only restart them after power is
                going up to BTR_CHARGE_STRIP (200 mv) more than the limit.
                2. PowerDownSleep - change in IO's when power is low.
                3. add DeepSleep - when restar is because of battery was insert - go to deep sleep. nothing works.
                4. if pivot connected and send GPS - so need to connect - only do it if next connection is more than hour.
VERSION: W.6.17.3
